# Escape The Mansion
This is a prototype of a horror game. While it may not feature extravagant elements, it was developed within a tight seven-day deadline as a school assignment.
Though it's possible that some minor bugs might have slipped through the cracks during development, I've diligently addressed and resolved any issues I've come across.

I thoroughly enjoyed the process of creating this prototype, and I'm confident that it has successfully achieved its intended purpose.

# Development Resources for the Project
The assets I used can be found on the Unity Asset Store:  
Synty Pack - Horror Mansion

Additionally, the audio was generated using free AI text-to-speech tools and subsequently edited by me through
the Reaper DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Other sounds used, can also be found on web-sites that provide free sound sampled.
The code for the project was also authored by me.
